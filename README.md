# Flood
A simple C++/SDL2 rendition of Drench, made for learning purposes. 

Utilizes the stack-based recursive implementation of the flood fill algorithm.

# Controls

Use your mouse to click on one of the six buttons at the bottom of the screen - choose a color, and flood the whole board with it to win the game.

Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out. Click and drag to move the view.

You can also press 1-6 on your keyboard to choose the colors, and use WASD to move the view.
